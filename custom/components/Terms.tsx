      <p>
        To any and all prospective holders, purchasers, assignees, or transferees (“You” or “Your”, as applicable) of
        the API3 Ethereum tokens (“API3 Tokens”), by your participation in the relevant token distribution and
        interaction with the materials herein and with the API3 Tokens themselves, You acknowledge Your understanding
        and agreement with the disclaimers herein:
      </p>
      <p>
        API3 tokens permit governing, directing, and participating in the API3 Decentralized Autonomous Organization
        (“API3 DAO”), and are not to be treated as investments of any nature. The API3 Token confers only membership in
        the API3 DAO and do not impart or guarantee any economic benefits or returns of any kind to its holders, and
        staking the API3 Token may involve different risks of loss of the API3 Token, including but not limited to the
        data feed insurance incentives and penalties (more thoroughly described at api3.org). The operation, maintenance
        and overall success of the API3 DAO and protocol depends on the efforts of a disparate group of actors
        constituting the API3 DAO and sub-DAOs therein, and as such the products and services described herein involve
        substantial risk. Materials published by the API3 DAO, API3 Limited Company (the “API3 Company”), The API3
        Foundation Limited Company (the “API3 Foundation”), or any affiliate or related entity to the foregoing
        (collectively, “API3”) do not constitute the provision of advisory services regarding investment, tax, legal,
        financial, accounting, consulting or any other related services, nor are they a recommendation to purchase any
        token, product or service. All materials published by API3 reflect the information available as of the time of
        publishing, are subject to change at any time without notice, and shall in no circumstance incur any liability
        for any direct or consequential loss arising out of the use of any API3 materials or communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        You represent and warrant You are not: (i) in violation of any laws relating to economic sanctions, anti-money
        laundering, or anti-corruption; (ii) restricted or prohibited in dealings by a global sanctions authority
        (including but not limited to the Security Council of the United Nations, the European Union, or the U.S. Office
        of Foreign Assets and Control) (a "Sanctions Authority"), (iii) a citizen of or domiciled in (at any time) a
        country sanctioned by a Sanctions Authority including, but not limited to, Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, and
        the Crimea region of Ukraine; and (iv) a citizen of or domiciled in any of the following jurisdictions for the
        API3 Token distribution: the United States (including its territories and dependencies, any state of the United
        States and the District of Columbia), Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Guyana, Iraq, Sudan, or Yemen.
      </p>
      <p>
        API3 has undertaken commercially reasonable screening measures, to the extent possible in a distribution
        performed by a decentralized exchange and accompanying DAO, to prevent any excluded persons or jurisdictions
        from participating in the sale, but as an additional measure relies upon Your representation that You are not
        excluded from participation in accord with the foregoing. Furthermore, API3 expressly disclaims and disavows any
        secondary transfers, sales, or assignments of the API3 Tokens by You and shall have no liability whatsoever for
        any such actions, further recipients, or usage of the API3 Tokens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Purchasing API3 Tokens for membership in the API3 DAO involves a high degree of various risks, including a
        possible loss of the entire purchase price. API3 DAO’s sector and market is highly competitive, new, and subject
        to innumerable legal and regulatory uncertainties, including as to the status or classification of the API3
        Token itself and its distribution, the status of the API3 DAO and its dealings, and the legal and regulatory
        treatment of the wider decentralized technology space generally. ​At any time the API3 Company and/or the API3
        Foundation may be compelled to cease operations or take actions that result in its dissolution—while such
        actions may not affect the continuance of the API3 DAO, they may impact API3 DAO’s and API3’s developments,
        legal classification, intellectual property status, commercial relationships, and other interactions between the
        various entities that support the development of API3. ​
      </p>
      <p>
        A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to send and otherwise interact with API3 Tokens
        stored in Your Ethereum wallet. Accordingly, loss of sole control of such private key(s) (including by any third
        party’s access to such private keys) associated with Your wallet can result in a loss of such API3 Tokens.
        Further, Your failure to properly follow the procedures for API3 Token distribution, for example providing an
        incorrect or non-compatible wallet address, may result in the loss of Your API3 Tokens.
      </p>
      <p>
        The API3 protocol is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time and although API3
        intends for the API3 Tokens to function as described in the materials herein and accompanying whitepaper, the
        API3 DAO is free to alter the course of development or services (including the usage or purpose of API3 Tokens)
        as it chooses/as deemed advisable by the direction of API3 Token holders. Therefore, API3 Tokens may not meet
        any specific expectations You may have concerning the API3 Token’s value, utility, or usage. ​
      </p>
      <p>
        Malicious actors may attempt to interfere with the token distribution platform or the API3 Tokens in a variety
        of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks,
        Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing, any of the foregoing in manners out of API3’s control. Furthermore,
        because the API3 protocol and DAO is substantially based on open source software, there is a risk that a third
        party or an API3 member may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure
        of the API3 DAO, which could negatively affect the API3 Tokens, including their utility for accessing the API3
        DAO or related services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The legal and regulatory status and classification of API3 Tokens, DAOs, governance tokens generally and
        blockchain technology generally is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or
        whether governments and regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations and law, or enact future regulations
        or legislation, with respect to such technology and its future applications, including the API3 DAO and the API3
        Tokens. Enforcement actions could negatively impact API3 and the API3 Tokens in various ways, including but not
        limited to (solely for purposes of illustration) through a determination that the offering and
        distribution/purchase of the API3 Tokens constitutes unlawful activity or that the API3 Tokens represent
        regulated instruments requiring registration or licensing of those instruments or some or all of the parties
        involved in the offering and distribution/purchase thereof. API3 may cease to offer its services to people in
        specific jurisdictions in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation make it illegal to
        operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable for API3 to obtain the necessary regulatory
        approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.
